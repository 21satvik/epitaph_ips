## About The Project

Epitaph has a wide array of utilities to position your user in a building. The project is intended to be used to only calculate the position on the user's device. 
It has been written in Dart using the Flutter framework. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons are used to make the calculations possible.
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values are used to calculate the user’s location in the real world.
